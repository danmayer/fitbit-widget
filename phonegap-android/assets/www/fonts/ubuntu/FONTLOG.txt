This is the FONTLOG file for the Ubuntu Font Family and attempts to follow
the recommendations at:  http://scripts.sil.org/OFL-FAQ_web#43cecb44


Overview

The new Ubuntu Font Family was started to enable the personality of
Ubuntu to be seen and felt in every menu, button and dialog.
The typeface is sans-serif, uses OpenType features and is manually
hinted for clarity on desktop and mobile computing screens.

The scope of the Ubuntu Font Family includes all the languages used by
the various Ubuntu users around the world in tune with Ubuntu's
philosophy which states that every user should be able to use their
software in the language of their choice. So the Ubuntu Font Family
project will be extended to cover many more written languages.


History

The Ubuntu Font Family has been creating during 2010.  As of September 2010
coverage is provided for Latin, Cyrillic and Greek across Regular, Italic,
Bold and Bold-Italic.
